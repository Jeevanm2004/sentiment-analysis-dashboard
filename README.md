### Alternative Models

The dashboard supports easy model swapping. Other available models include:

- `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment`: Multilingual support
- `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`: Faster processing

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Models

To add new Hugging Face models:

1. Update the `available_models` dictionary in `app.py`:
```python
available_models = {
    "your-model-name": "Display Name",
    # ... existing models
}
```

2. Ensure the model outputs sentiment labels compatible with the app

### Styling Customization

Modify the CSS in the `st.markdown` section of `app.py` to change:
- Colors and themes
- Layout and spacing
- Font styles and sizes

### Adding Features

The modular code structure makes it easy to add:
- Batch processing for multiple texts
- Historical analysis tracking
- Additional visualization types
- Integration with external APIs

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Models require 400MB-1GB RAM
- Cached after first load
- Optimized for Streamlit Community Cloud limits

### Processing Speed
- First run: 30-60 seconds (model download)
- Subsequent runs: 1-3 seconds per analysis
- File uploads: Depends on file size

### Resource Optimization
- Models are cached using `@st.cache_resource`
- Efficient text processing with transformers
- Minimal memory footprint for visualizations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Loading Errors**:
- Ensure internet connectivity for model download
- Try switching to a different model
- Check if Hugging Face services are available

**Slow Performance**:
- Models are cached after first use
- Large texts may take longer to process
- Consider using DistilBERT for faster results

**Memory Issues**:
- Restart the app if memory usage is high
- Use shorter texts for analysis
- Clear browser cache if needed

### Error Messages

**"Error loading model"**: 
- Check internet connection
- Try a different model from the dropdown
- Refresh the page

**"Error analyzing sentiment"**:
- Ensure text input is not empty
- Check for special characters that might cause issues
- Try with simpler text first
